Beginner Level
Question:
What will be the output of the following code if x is initialized to 10 and y is initialized to 20, and then x is assigned the sum of x and y?
*/

// var x = 10
// var y = 20
// x = x + y
// console.log(x)  // output : 30

/*
Intermediate Level
Question:
What will be the output of the following code if a constant PI is defined as 3.14, a variable radius is initially set to 5 and then reassigned to 10, and the circumference is calculated as 2 * PI * radius?
*/

// const PI = 3.14
// var radius = 5
// radius = 10
// var circumference = 2 * PI * radius
// console.log(circumference)   // output = 62.8

Advanced Level
Question:
What will be the output of the following code when a constant x is initialized to 10, and within a block, a new constant x is initialized to 20, and both are logged inside and outside the block?
*/

// const x = 10
// {
//     const x = 20
//     console.log('x value inside the block',x)   //output = x value inside the block 20
// }
// console.log('x value outside the block',x)   //ouput = x value outside the block 10
